In order to keep the repo small, only the OpenMojis which are used by the components are distributed in the repo. If you want the random OpenMoji to include all available OpenMojis, simply download from OpenMoji and copy in the the respective folder. The OpenMoji PNG folder is ignore through .gitignore except the component's icons, if you want to commit all of your PNGs simply modify the .gitignore.
